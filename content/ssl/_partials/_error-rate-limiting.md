As mentioned in [Certificate authorities](/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/), specific CAs may have their own limitations. If you use Letâ€™s Encrypt and find the following error, it means you hit their [duplicate certificate limit](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/duplicate-certificate-limit/).

```txt
The authority has rate limited these domains. Please wait for the rate limit to expire or try another authority.
```

A certificate is considered a duplicate of an earlier certificate if it contains the exact same set of hostnames.

In this case, you can either wait for the rate limit window to end or choose a different certificate authority.
